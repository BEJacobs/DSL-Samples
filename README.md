# DSL-Samples

The ElectricFlow Domain Specific Language, EF DSL was introducted with ElectricFlow 5.4.  This DSL is based on the programming language Groovy and is run directly on the ElectricFlow server JVM.  It has full access to the ElectricFlow API and can be used for both authoring ElectricFlow content (procedures, workflow, pipelines, etc.) and for automation.

This repository contains examples of DSL code.  For the samples at the root of this repository, the instructions are contained in the files themselves. The application 'onboarding' example has its own README with details and instructions
